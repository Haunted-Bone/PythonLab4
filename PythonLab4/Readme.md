Working from simple shapes, to more complex shapes, to full images
really made the value and utility of encapsulation clear. Being able to pass parameters
down a series of functions within each other like russian nesting dolls
clearly helps make code reusable. It also helps with generalization of code. Being able to 
give a pre-existing function a broader use by having variables handed down to it from a more general
function it is sitting within is great. It does mean we have to be even more careful with our variable naming schemes
and making sure that none of them get confused for one another or have their name changed or mistyped anywhere within
the code.
